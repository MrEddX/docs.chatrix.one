   <figcaption>Terms and Conditions of <b>Chatrix.One</b></figcaption>
</figure>

In general, I am far from the thought of imposing any restrictions. However, practice has shown that in order for a community to exist and function, the presence and observance of certain rules is mandatory. The **XMPP** service offered by **Chatrix.One** is no exception. Precisely for this reason, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with the rules that **every** user, moderator or administrator must follow.

## [TL;DR](https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR)

- Do not exercise unauthorized access;
- Respect other users and be tolerant;
- Do not use the service to organize and carry out illegal activities;
- For persons under 16 years of age, registration must be done with the consent of a parent or guardian.

!!! warning "Warning"

     Please be aware that **Chatrix.One** is not responsible for the actions of its registered users. Each user is solely responsible for their own actions and behavior while using the service.

## They are forbidden

- Illegal access to the service;
- Messages containing offensive and obscene phrases, racist or other similar definitions, leading to harassment of other users of the service;

- Only registered and not used for more than 7 days;

     In the event that your profile is marked for deletion, you will receive a system message warning you of the upcoming event. You will be given an opportunity to take action if you wish to have the deletion canceled.

     The action of automated profile deletion is **irreversible**! There is no undo mechanism. The only thing you can do is create a new registration and start over.

## Reporting a violation

In case you wish to report a violation, please send an email or **XMPP** message to an administrator. The report must be accompanied by proof in the form of a screenshot - [Screenshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot), which unequivocally shows the violation you described.
